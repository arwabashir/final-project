Sprint Review
What did you learn from doing our second sprint?
-We learned how to distribute our tasks effectively and made sure to start early on.
What did go well? Why?
-We didn't feel as rushed towards the end like we did for Sprint 1. We felt as if we had enough time to discuss and ask questions if we ever got stuck on something.
What didn’t go well? Why not?
-I believe something that went wrong was our approach to website styling. Instead of primarily focusing on functionality and worrying about styling for later, we should have styled the website concurrently. This would have not only saved time in the future but also prevented confusion from referring back to older code. 
How can you make things better next time?
-Next time, we will work on functionality and styling at the same time. 
Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
-Yes, I believe we are on a good track to achieve our goals. I believe at first we started off slow but we acknowledged our weaknesses early on and made sure to step up and work harder and more often as the second sprint came around.
Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
- ANSWER THIS!!!!!!

Sprint review
What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
- We learned how important it is to be in constant communication with our client so that we can ensure that we are meeting their website needs. We found that regular client check-ins work best for us and for the client, to make sure that they are aware of changes that we’ve made and that we are up to date with all the information about the company. 
What did go well? Why?
- We delegated work according to our strengths well and we were able to cohesively work (in terms of coding) on the website because of our strong communication in our group chat. Whenever someone made a change (as in making a new branch) they reminded the others to pull and fetch. Communicating with the client went great as well because one of the members is able to directly contact them, so we didn’t have to worry about long reply times or feedback.
What didn’t go well? Why not?
- It was hard to find time to meet and work on the project because it’s midterm season. We were all really busy with our classes and other school commitments, which prevented us from easily finding time to get together and work on the project. However, we all communicated with each other and used “When2Meet” to find time that overlapped on our schedules. 
We were not able to work on the tasks throughout the week and were only able to delegate specific times to complete a majority of the tasks, which caused our burndown chart to look back-loaded. 
How can you make things better next time?
- Because we struggled with finding time to meet, we think that we should implement more Zoom meetings with another to work on our project collaboratively. If we meet on Zoom, it allows for more flexibility in scheduling times to meet for our team.  
Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
- Yes, we are satisfied with what we have already completed. We believe that as we continue to work on our project together, we will be able to make it look even better. 
Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
- Group 1 was invited and everyone was present. The notes we got from their group:
   They liked the color scheme that we used for our website and thought that it was nice having our contact information and hours in the footer, giving easy access to people who view the website. Some feedback given was that they think it would be nice if we add a margin or border around our text on the home page, if we replace the picture we have with a real photograph from our organization, and to add a title to our home page – whether it be “Home,” or our company slogan/mission statement.
